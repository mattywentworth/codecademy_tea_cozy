<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This project is a part of Codecademy's full stack career path coursework. This is the project that comes after learning some initial responsive design concepts, and the main purpose is to use recent learnings about flexbox.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>The projects on Codecademy come with a brief explanation of the purpose, resources/content necessary to complete the project, and a Get Unstuck section if you need help. This resources for this project were some image URLs and <a href="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg?_gl=1*10kd7sj*_ga*MjEwNTEwODUyOS4xNjgxNDA2NzQz*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY4NjkyNjgxMy44OC4xLjE2ODY5Mjc3NjAuNTAuMC4w">this design spec.</a></p>
<p>I started by creating the relevant folders and files using commands in the terminal. I then wrote most of the HTML and about 70% of the CSS before creating a repo in GitHub and committing the HTML and CSS files.</p>
<p>After completing about 99% of the CSS based on the design spec, I committed my updates. I think the main updates I need to consider are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Editing the 2 background images so that they shrink with the window. I set these images using background-image in the CSS, but I'm thinking that I may need to consider setting it as a separate div, editing the position and z-index to move the relevant text on top of the image, and setting the flex-shrink value appropriately.</li>
  <li>Setting the flex-shrink values of other text and images.</li>
  <li>Reviewing the design spect to make sure I got all the width, heigh, margin values, etc correct.</li>
